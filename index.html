<h4>A 10-day social canvassing mission in Iowa</h4>
<div class="elevator-pitch">
    <p>Yang Party is assembling high energy humans to paint Ames red white and blue for Andrew Yang</p>
    <p>Andrew is running a 21st century campaign, and this calls for 21st century canvassing. Knocking on doors is
        important work for reaching voters. However, many people find it unnatural. Making matters worse, some voters
        refuse to open their doors, and many college students live in dorms where we can't even knock.
        <p>Yang Party advocates a new form of canvassing, where <p>canvassers are paid a basic income of
                $33/day
                for each day they party with the group</p>. With these funds, we can spend time and money at local
            businesses in
            public spaces, where people are naturally more open to conversations. We can leverage the energy of the Yang
            Gang by lighting up coffee shops, restaurants, bars, yoga studios, college campuses and more. Instead of
            cold approaching Iowans at their homes, let them see how much fun we are and connect with them
            as humans first</p>
        <p>This idea was inspired by <a href="https://yangweek.org">Yang Week</a> and <a
                href="https://twitter.com/sororityofyang">Sorority of Yang</a>. We saw first hand how well our message
            is received in a pub filled with warm, inclusive people wearing MATH hats. We're launching a movement to
            <b>show</b> voters our powerful platform, rather than merely <b>telling</b> them about it. The Freedom
            Dividend is the most tangible policy ever proposed: so let's give people money to spend at local businesses
            in Iowa. We believe there is no more effective way to reach with Iowans </p>
        <p>
            As we onboard the local population to the Yang Gang, they too will be able to
            opt in to the Yang Party dividend, so long as they
            indeed spend all day with us keeping the party alive and spreading the word to their friends and family!
        </p>
</div>
<div class="funding">
    <h4>How do we pay for it?</h4>
    <p>Between the dividend and hotel rooms, <b>each person will cost about $420 per 7 days.</b> The creator of Yang
        Party
        will seed the fund with money to support 10 partiers for one week. After we receive 70 days worth of
        commitments, we will begin accepting donations. We continue to be astonished by the
        fundraising abilities of the Yang Gang, and we're open to this becoming as big as the people can make it.
