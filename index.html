<h1>Yang Party</h1>
<h2>🍻 🧢 🌮 🧢 🧘🏽‍♀️ 🧢 🍾 🧢 🎳 🧢 🕺 🧢 🍷</h2>
<h4>A final, 10-day long celebration to Yang college towns in Iowa</h4>
<div class="elevator-pitch">
    <p>Yang Party is assembling high energy humans to paint Iowa City red white and blue for Andrew Yang</p>
    <p>Andrew is running a 21st century campaign, and this calls for 21st century canvassing. Knocking on doors is
        important work for reaching voters. However, many people find it unnatural. Making matters worse, some voters
        refuse to open their doors, and many college students live in dorms where we can't even knock.
        <p>Yang Party advocates a new form of canvassing, where <p>canvassers are paid a universal basic income of
                $33/day
                for each day they party with the group</p>. With these funds, we can spend time and money at local
            businesses in
            public spaces, where people are naturally more open to conversations. We can leverage the energy of the Yang
            Gang by lighting up coffee shops, restaurants, bars, yoga studios, college campuses and more. Instead of
            cold approaching Iowans at their homes, let them see how much fun we are and allow them to connect with us
            as humans first.</p>
